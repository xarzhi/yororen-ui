# `upstream/` — public-API baselines

This directory contains `cargo public-api` baselines for the
5 published crates in the workspace. They are the source of
truth for what the public surface of each crate looks like.

## Format

One `.api.txt` per published crate:

| File | Crate |
| --- | --- |
| `yororen_ui_core.api.txt` | `yororen_ui_core` (`yororen-ui-core`) |
| `yororen_ui_theme_system.api.txt` | `yororen_ui_theme_system` (`yororen-ui-theme-system`) |
| `yororen_ui_theme_catppuccin.api.txt` | `yororen_ui_theme_catppuccin` (`yororen-ui-theme-catppuccin`) |
| `yororen_ui_theme_material.api.txt` | `yororen_ui_theme_material` (`yororen-ui-theme-material`) |
| `yororen_ui.api.txt` | `yororen_ui` (`yororen-ui` meta-crate) |

Each file is the `--simplified` output of `cargo public-api` —
flat, one-public-item-per-line, no type bodies. That makes
diffs human-reviewable and easy to skim in a PR.

## When to update

Update the baseline when you intentionally ship a breaking
change to the public surface. Concretely:

1. **Run** the local baseline generation command (see below).
2. **Diff** the new baseline against the old one. Every
   removed / changed line is a breaking change.
3. **Update** `MIGRATION.md` (or `./tmp/MIGRATION_*.md` until
   the wiki process picks it up) with the migration recipe
   for every changed item.
4. **Commit** the new baseline alongside the code change
   that caused it. One commit, atomic — never leave the
   baseline out of sync with the code.
5. **Tag** the release (the next published version will
   advertise the breaking change in its CHANGELOG).

## Local baseline generation

```bash
# All 5 published crates
for pair in \
    "yororen_ui_core:yororen-ui-core" \
    "yororen_ui_theme_system:yororen-ui-theme-system" \
    "yororen_ui_theme_catppuccin:yororen-ui-theme-catppuccin" \
    "yororen_ui_theme_material:yororen-ui-theme-material" \
    "yororen_ui:yororen-ui"; do
  crate="${pair%%:*}"
  # The filename uses underscores (`yororen_ui_*.api.txt`) to
  # match the crate's `cargo` name; the crate *directory* uses
  # dashes (`yororen-ui-*.api.txt`). The script below writes to
  # the underscored filename, which is the committed convention.
  case "$crate" in
    yororen_ui_core)              fn="upstream/yororen_ui_core.api.txt" ;;
    yororen_ui_theme_system)      fn="upstream/yororen_ui_theme_system.api.txt" ;;
    yororen_ui_theme_catppuccin)  fn="upstream/yororen_ui_theme_catppuccin.api.txt" ;;
    yororen_ui_theme_material)    fn="upstream/yororen_ui_theme_material.api.txt" ;;
    yororen_ui)                   fn="upstream/yororen_ui.api.txt" ;;
  esac
  cargo public-api -p "${crate}" --simplified >| "$fn"
done
```

Note: the `>|` redirect (not `>`) is required when `setopt
NO_CLOBBER` is enabled in your shell — otherwise the
`public-api` regeneration silently no-ops against the existing
file and you'll think you've refreshed the baseline when you
haven't.

## CI

The `public-api diff` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs
the same generation on every push to `dev` / `main` and every
PR, then `diff -u`s against the committed baseline. A
non-empty diff fails the job. The error message tells the
contributor to either fix the code or update the baseline.

## What counts as "public"?

- Every `pub fn`, `pub struct`, `pub enum`, `pub trait`,
  `pub type`, `pub const` re-exported from the crate root.
- Re-exports (`pub use foo::Bar`) — these are how
  third-party crates import items, so they count.
- Trait impls are not listed (they're implicit).

## What does NOT count?

- Items in `#[cfg(test)]` modules.
- Items behind non-default feature flags (the public-api
  binary runs with default features only).
- Doc-only items (`#[doc(hidden)]`).

## Limitations

- The public-api binary requires the crate to compile in the
  default feature configuration. Crates that fail to build
  with default features will show up as "diff = full API
  missing", which is a false positive. Always keep the default
  build green before regenerating baselines.
- `--simplified` does not surface trait implementations
  separately. If your breaking change is "this type no longer
  implements Trait X", the baseline diff won't catch it.
  Combine the public-api diff with a downstream-app smoke
  test in CI if you need that level of coverage.
