//! `ButtonRenderer` trait — the data contract that every
//! third-party renderer (default, brutalism, …) implements to
//! describe a `Button`'s visual.
//!
//! Lives in core (not the default-renderer) so headless
//! `ButtonProps::render` can call `compose`. The trait surface
//! is intentionally minimal: a single `compose` method that
//! takes the full `ButtonProps` and returns a fully-built
//! `Stateful<Div>` (visuals + children + hover / active + id +
//! focus). All token reads, palette lookups and styling
//! choices live inside the renderer — core does not know
//! about `bg` / `fg` / `border` / etc.
//!
//! `ButtonRenderState` is provided as a convenience projection
//! of `ButtonProps` for renderers that want to share helpers
//! across the suite (e.g. token-based vs. brutalist), but it
//! is not part of the trait surface.
